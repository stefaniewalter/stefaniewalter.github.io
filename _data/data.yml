career-profile:
    title: Research
    summary: |
       My research interests are in the area of political and science communication, while my methodological focus is on quantitative methods and computational social science with a special interest
       in text and image analysis. Together with my team I explore how the news media report on majority and minority groups based on nationality, gender, religion, and sexual orientation and the visual
       image of climate change on social media.
